## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Detection
```bash
# Automatic architecture detection in scripts
ARCH=$(uname -m)
case $ARCH in
    x86_64) TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 ;;
    aarch64|arm64) TARGET_ARCH=arm ;;
    armv7l) TARGET_ARCH=arm ;;
    *) echo "Unsupported architecture: $ARCH"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

### Build System Changes
- **Makefile**: Added `TARGET_ARCH` variable with conditional logic
- **CMake**: Separate CMakeLists.txt files for different architectures
- **Native Code**: Mock implementations for X86_64 hardware features

### Mock Implementations
X86_64 implementations provide software alternatives for ARM hardware features:
- **Video Capture**: Simulated 1920x1080@60fps stream
- **USB HID**: Software-based keyboard/mouse simulation
- **Hardware Display**: Console logging instead of hardware control
- **EDID Management**: Mock EDID data generation

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Building for X86_64
```bash
# Development build
./build_x86.sh --dev

# Release build
./build_x86.sh --release

# Test build system
./test_x86_build.sh
```

### GitHub Actions Triggers
```bash
# Automatic build on push
git push origin main

# Create release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Manual workflow dispatch via GitHub UI
```

### Docker Usage
```bash
# Pull X86_64 image
docker pull ghcr.io/your-repo-x86_64:latest

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/your-repo-x86_64:latest
```

## 📝 Notes

### Known Limitations
1. **Video Quality**: X86_64 uses simulated video instead of real capture
2. **USB Features**: Software simulation may have different behavior than hardware
3. **Performance**: Some features may be slower in software implementation
4. **Hardware Integration**: X86_64 version cannot control physical KVM hardware

### Migration Path
For users wanting to migrate from ARM to X86_64:
1. Export configuration from ARM version
2. Install X86_64 version using provided scripts
3. Import configuration and adjust hardware-specific settings
4. Test functionality and adjust as needed

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

✅ **Multi-Architecture Support**: Successfully added X86_64 alongside ARM  
✅ **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated building, testing, and releasing  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples  
✅ **Docker Integration**: Container support for easy deployment  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: ARM functionality remains unchanged  
✅ **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and code quality checks  

The JetKVM project now supports both embedded ARM hardware and standard X86_64 systems, significantly expanding its potential user base and use cases while maintaining the original ARM functionality.
